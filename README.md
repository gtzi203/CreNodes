CreNodes  v1.0.0
----------------

Description:

CreNodes adds useful nodes for the creative mode, like barriers or light nodes.


Features:

Barrier Node, which acts like a invisible, unbreakable wall.
15 Light Node variants, which have a lightlevel from 1-15.
Light Switcher, that can increase or decrease the light level of the Light Nodes by clicking on them.

(all these items are normally creative-mode exclusive, but their crafting recipes can be turned on in the settings)


Installation:

1. Download or clone the repository: https://github.com/gtzi203/CreNodes.git

2. Place the CreNodes folder into your mods folder.

3. Enable the mod via the in-game mod manager.


Dependencies:

Minetest engine version 5.10.0 or higher
Required mod: default (bundled with Minetest Game)
Optional mod: unified_inventory (for a better inventory)


Usage:

Barrier: Place it and hold the barrier item in your hand to see the invisble barrier nodes.
Light: Place it and hold the light item in your hand to see the invisble light nodes.
       Only the light nodes with the light level of the light item you are holding will show up (for example: you hold the light level "5" light, particles will spawn on light nodes with the light level "5")
Light Switcher: Hold it in you hand and all light nodes will spawn particles with their light level on it.
                By rightclicking on a light node the light level of that light node will increase and when you leftclick a light node, its light level will be decreased.

In the Minetest settings you can customize the mod, as you like it.
